Brain Storming

Make a list of your favorite 3-5 applications and identify 2-3 features that make them your favorite app. It's okay if features repeat on different apps
-Chess: Features I appreciate from Chess.com are the speed from the opening of the application to commencing a game with a friend or stranger.
The capability of writing complex messages in the middle of a game.

-Snapchat: I love how easy it is to communicate with people of similar interests, for example, "FIU2025" is a group Snapchat story where students can make friends and post whatever they would like to show their fellow classmates. Uploading a photo or video is quicker than ever and the editing process has improved tremendously throughout the years.

-Mint: An amazing banking app that allows you to connect all forms of banking and credit cards in one easy-to-read place. Charts with real-time statistics show how your money is being spent daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly.

If I could build an app it would most likely be a banking app that calculates the amount of time it would take to pay off a certain credit card or mortgage with estimations of months and years. With monthly subscriptions and hidden fees on the rise, my app would assist users to realistically see how much their purchases would be paid off in
time frames that could assist their planning for the future.
-Features would include:
  -An accountability tab to allow a friend or family member to monitor the spending towards a certain bill.
  -Customize color features to change the layout of your app to be more personal and attractive to the user.
  -A donation feature to allow other users to "chip in" towards a common goal such as "go fund me"
